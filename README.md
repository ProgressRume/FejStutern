Hello, here are links to my assignments on Airtable cards and Recipe HTML project. 
P.S Please I was creating all my assignments in one repo and since we now have to create a link, I had to create two different repos and I am attaching the links here. I am sorry it is a bit complicated.

This is the link to the new repo for Airtable Cards - https://github.com/ProgressRume/AirtableCard.git
And this is the deployed link - https://progressrume.github.io/AirtableCard/

This is the link to the new repo for the HTML project assignment - https://github.com/ProgressRume/Recipe-Assignment.git
And this is the deployed link - https://progressrume.github.io/Recipe-Assignment/

Apologies for the inconveniences
